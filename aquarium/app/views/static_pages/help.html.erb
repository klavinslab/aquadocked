However, if you insist on questioning your future, information about a few 
intricate details of Aquarium things can be found by following the links below.</p>

<h2>Locations</h2>

<h3 class='help'>Bench Locations</h3>

<p>If an item is stored on a shelf, drawer, etc, it will have a
location of the form <b>B1.510</b>, which in this case means Bay 1,
location 510. The first digit of 510 is the height from the floor,
with the 300s being bench level. Thus, 500 is two shelves up from the
bench. The second two digits, in this case 10, show where on the shelf
going from left to right across the bay. So <b>B1.510</b> means bay 1,
second shelf above the bench, near the left most side of the
bay. There are stickers that should guide you to the exact spot.</p>

<h3 class='help'>Sample Locations</h3>

<p>Samples are stored using various prefixes, which are handled by the
<i>Location Wizard</i>, a piece of software that determines the next
available location for a newly minted sample. Any ObjectType can be
associated with a prefix which then determines the behavior of the
Location Wizard. The association of ObjectType to prefix can be made
on either the 'New ObjectType' or 'Edit ObjectType' page. </p>

<p>All sample locations have the form <b>PR.x.y.z</b> where PR is one
of the prefixes described below, and x, y and z are location
identifiers that have specific meanings according to the prefix. As an
example, if a sample has the location <b>M20.4.5.87</b>, then it is
stored in a -20C freezer in hotel 4, box 5, slot 87.</p>

<p>The currently recognized prefixes and their behaviors are as follows.</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>M20.x.y.z</b> The -20C sample space is separated into
  aluminum hotels, numbered x=0,1,2, ... The number of hotels is
  essentially unlimited (we'll buy more as we need them). Which hotels
  are in which freezer should be shown on the door of the
  freezer. Each hotel holds y=0..15 boxes, and each box has z=0..99
  slots numbered from the upper left, then accross the top row ro slot
  9, then to the left of the next row for 10-19, etc. When a new
  sample is made in an ObjectType with prefix M20, the location wizard
  determines the new address by finding the next slot in the box with
  samples of the same project (a.k.a. category), or a new box if such
  box is full. Thus, only samples with for the same project will be
  found in a given box.</li>

  <br />

  <li><b>M80.x.y.z</b> The -80C sample space is organized the same
  way as the -20C sample space.</li>

  <br />

  <li><b>DFS.x.y.z</b> The deli fridge sample space is organized the same
  way as the -20C sample space.</li>

  <br />

  <li><b>SFw.0.y.z</b> There are a number of small -20C freezers in
  the lab number SF1, SF2, ... These each contain boxes, numbered
  y=0,1,2,... The location wizard puts new samples stored in
  ObjectTypes with prefix SF1, SF2, etc into boxes according to
  project by assigning the next available slot, which might be in a
  new box if the current project boxes are full.</li>

</ul>
